# Document-reconstruction

This project will consist of two parts: software and hardware.

## Software part

The purpose of the software part of this project:

1. **Image stitching**
2. **Text orientation correction in images**
3. *Framing text areas in images*
4. *OCR* (We will focus on OCR for handwritten Chinese and img2tex)
5. Text Correction (We will focus on Text Correction for Chinese)
6. Build the website and deploy the deep learning model to the cloud platform
7. more

## Hardware part

The purpose of the hardware part of this project:

1. Getting the images and remove them to the 
2. Transferring them to the device that performs the image processing
3. *Turning the pages of the book automatically*
4. more

# What should we do

I will introduce the overall project implementation idea according to two directions: software part and hardware part

## Software part

### Image Matching

wu use **SIFT/ORB & knnMatch**ï¼Œ the basic idea of this module is as follows:

1.  Extracte the features of the two images
2.  Feature points matching
3.  Connect the matched feature points
4.  Homograph

> **Note:**
>
> when you use ORB, the homograph will not work
>
> please wait until we has fixed this bug

### Page Dewarping

we use the 

**Hough Linear Inspection & math**, so easy, pass

you can see test samples in ['rotated_result'](https://github.com/hhhfccz/Document-reconstruction/tree/main/rotated_result)

### Framing text areas in images

my idea is to use **MSER and NMS**
I made all text detectable by adding CLAHE

# How to use

make sure:

> opencv-python >= 4.4.0
> 
> opencv-python-contrib >= 4.4.0

OK! just do it!

> python main.py

so easy
